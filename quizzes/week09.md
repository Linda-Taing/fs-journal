# Working in a Professional Environment

**1.** What is Inheritance?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Inheritance allows a new class to use the properties and methods of an existing class. For example with extended our Profile Model from the Account model and were able to use all of the  Account Model properties. This also helps us avoid duplicating code in multiple classes, it also keeps the code organized, efficient and maintainable.

```
**2.** What is the `Singleton` design pattern?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
This design pattern is in the object-oriented programming. This provides a global variable throughout the code. Saved in the AppState in our case that is reactive. 
```
**3.** What is the `Observer` design pattern?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
This is defined as a one to many dependency.  So if the observer changes then all of its dependents automatically update. It always consists of its subject and a listener. The reason for this pattern is to build reactive and event-driven systems. I can write more reusable code.

```
**4.** What is the `Strategy` design pattern?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```\
Strategy pattern is useful for encapsulating complex behaviors. Allowing them to be interchangeable for flexibility and maintainability in the code.

```
**5.** What is the `Factory` design pattern?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Factory pattern is designed for creating objects in a flexible way. This part of the code can be more testable and maintainable because you can separate the object from the rest of the app.
```
**6.** What is test driven development?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Also known as the TDD is where your write your test for your code before writing the code. As in PostMan tests we had in the Tower. This ensures our code is correct  and testing it before completely writing and building out the application. It also helps when working with team members that the backend is tested so that frontend can be written simply and verified quickly to backend.
```
**7.** In Scrum/Agile what is the DoD?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Definition of Done is for the team to understand what needs to be considered as complete to be able to release the product or meeting expectations.
```
**8.** Give two examples of a user story:
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
A user story is a simple description of a feature or requirement in software. 
-   "As a [registered user], I want to be able to [reset my password if I forget it] so that [I can regain access to my account]." 
-    "As an [online shopper], I want to be able to [add items to cart and view total] so that [I can keep track of purchases]. "
In the square braces those are to be able to replace those with user roles, actions and benefit/value because we want to ensure we focus on what is needed by the user.

```
**9.** During which ceremony is your Sprint Backlog created?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
During Sprint Planning. This is held at the beginning of each Sprint. This involves the entire Scrum Team: Product Owner, Dev Team, and Scrum Master.
```
**10.** In which of these ceremonies are Tasks assigned to you?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Once the Sprint Planning is completed the Dev Team will divy out the items into smaller manageable tasks. The team members will discuss and agree on the responsible tasks. Using the trello is important because it is a live mode task manager that can hold the team accountable with proper labeling and time frames.
