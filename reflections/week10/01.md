## Questions

1. What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?

-   Value type: holds a data value in its memory space. examples are bool, enum, decimal and many others.
    Reference type: stores the address of the location where the actual value is stored. example String, arrays, class, and delegate.
    Pointer type: CSharp is a form of pointer type. They do not inherit from object and no conversions exist between pointer types and object. Example: int* p1,p2,p3 is ok NOT int *p1, *p2, *p3.

2. What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?

3. In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types?
