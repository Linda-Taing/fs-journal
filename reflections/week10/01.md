## Questions

1. What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?

-   Value type: holds a data value in its memory space. examples are bool, enum, decimal and many others.
    Reference type: stores the address of the location where the actual value is stored. example String, arrays, class, and delegate.
    Pointer type: CSharp is a form of pointer type. They do not inherit from object and no conversions exist between pointer types and object. Example: int* p1,p2,p3 is ok NOT int *p1, *p2, *p3.

2. What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?

-   value-types consist of a bool, byte, char, decimal, double, enum, float, int, long, sbyte, short, struct, uint, ulong, ushort. The different is CSharp defines custom value types by their structure. Javascript is Number, String, Boolean, Null, and Undefined.

3. In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types?

-    I am unsure of how the Reference gets stored. according to the read, when you pass a reference type from one method to another it doesn't create a new copy. it passes the variable's address.
