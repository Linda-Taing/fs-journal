## Questions

1. In a SQL table, what is the difference between information in a row and information in a column?

-   The column information is the set information for data being stored. This will be set in a Model. The properties for this section will in take the value and be set in the rows as a single record of data, which corresponds to the data being stored.

2. Demonstrate the basic structure for creating a new table called `characters` with the values `name, age, description` as strings, and an `int` id.

-   As we did to build GregsListSharp we would create a table like this:
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS characters(
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    age INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 13,
    description VARCHAR(255)
)

3. What are the difference between the following statements: 
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name;
DROP TABLE table_name;
```
-   The difference is DELETE FROM is part of the CRUD method, whereas DROP TABLE will erase the table created to store data on the database.

-   ALTHOUGH still slow I've been able to complete both Labs by the end of the day and also understand the movement of the backend of CSHarp. I am going to try to connect it to the front end and see how it goes! To Practice client side.
