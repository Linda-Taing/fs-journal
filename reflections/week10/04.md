## Questions

1. What is an Enum, and what are some use cases for them?

-   Enums are strongly typed data type. When using an Enum, they are used to represent values that do not change. EX is type of car engine in Gregslist. Giving the specific value to choose from. We use them when we enforce valid values and prevent invalid values. Also improves the readability of code.

2. How can you modify an Enum?

-   ENUMS themselves can't be modified but you can modify their members. You can add a new name-value to the definition such as adding a V6 into the engine Enum of V8, 4 cylinder, V10, amd then adding V6. But you shouldn't delete from an Enum because it can affect an existing code, but deprecating of [obsolete] can help this action.

3. How have you used Enums in your afternoon lab projects this far?(if you have not yet, give an example of how you could)

-   I've not yet used ENUMS in CSHarp but have used them in previous Gregslist. Sadly this is our Last Dance.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment.
- Partner Code Day. I am looking forward to this because this will help us figure out how the Backend and frontend come together.
