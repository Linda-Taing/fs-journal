## Questions

1. What is a List in C#?

-   It is a generic type. instead of an array in javascript this is the option. 

2. What List methods seem like you might use them often? Why?

-   I think I would use the 
List.Add: be able to add an item into a C# 'array' known as list. 
List.Find: works for looking through the list to be able to find an item.
List.FindAll: works for looking through the list to find all.
List.Remove: take out a list item.

3. How would you retrieve an item from a list? What method could you use?

-  There are many methods depending on which item you'd like to retrieve, or items. List.Find, List.FindAll, List.FindIndex. List.FindLast, List.FindLastIndex, even by getting a range of items List.GetRange.
