## Questions

1. What is an SSL certificate?

-   SSL certificates are small data files that are encrypted between the server and browser. This ensures that the browser is private and secure/safe.

2. What are the different types of certificates? What are they used for?

-   Extended Validation: This shows that that the website is not a spam site. It shows the padlocks, HTTPS , business name and business country in the address bar. Most expensive to obtain
    Organization Validated: This validates that the organization domain is legitimate. This is a medium level of encryption.
    Domain Validation: Low level of encryption has a green padlock in address bar. This route is enough for a business to receive encrypted information but  gets the job done.
    Wildcard SSL Certificate: This one is to buy one certificate for one domain but can use for subdomains as well. This is the cheaper option. This is for multiple- domain names to have the same certificate. It was created to bridge the communication of the server and browser with the same owner. Also has a padlock display.
    Unified Communications (UCC) SSL Certificate:
    Single Domain SSL Certificate: Secures the one domain.



3. What are some benefits of using SSL certificates?

-   Primarily the SSL is to secure information between the user and your website or websites. Assuring that you are not a spam site, or that you are a legitimate organization.
