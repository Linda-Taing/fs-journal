## Questions

1. What technologies and principles are you using in your project?

-   The technologies we are using in our Capstone are Vue.js framework, and Node.js for our backend. As for API we had to build our own so that came with building a database in MongoDb. our developmental side we use the HTML and Sass to be able to work with our client side on building a friendly User Experience.

2. What went well so far?

-   So far team work has been good we do a lot of partner coding to have a driver and navigator. We also try and troubleshoot as a team when the pair can't find a resolution.

3. What would you do differently? Why?

-   I wish I was confident in the work that I do. I want to be able to contribute more to the team.
