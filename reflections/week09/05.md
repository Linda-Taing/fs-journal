# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?
-    This week has been great but I am looking forward to being back in lecture and structure to learn about C# and practice coding again. I hope that i am not losing the practice and learning to path my way through the code. I want to start adding to our Capstone of the Sponsor page. I think that would be really cool to show case for cohort!
