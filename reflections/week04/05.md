# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?




-   So far this week that went well was I actually understood and could follow along with lab tasks. The PokeDex was more challenging but Savannah and Mick really helped me through it all and was able to guide me through my road blocks. My surprise this week was how i thought it was a trap week because I could understand more throughout the week. The struggle is the digging through multiple tiers of informationa from the API and storing in another API. I am still here is my Victory! haha... I am really enjoying the course and have a great cohort group.
