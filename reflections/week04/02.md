## Questions

1. What are the three states of a `Promise`?

-   The three states are:
    Pending
    Resolved
    Rejected

2. How do `promise`s seek to resolve the issues of "callback hell"?

-   Their resolution to callback is chaining. This helps because it has multiple call backs one after another.

3. What is the difference between `.then()` and `.catch()`?
    - The 'then()' is for a resolved method of promise. The 'catch()' is used when there is a rejected promise.
