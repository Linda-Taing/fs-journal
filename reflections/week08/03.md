## Questions

1. What is Software Development Testing?

-   Being able to test small parts of the app without running the complete app. The analogies from the reading talk about cars are built from many components from different companies yet they all work together. They test a button that can withstand 10,000 presses. A bolt can be  screwed and unscrewed correctly to the nut.

2. What are the benefits of Testing in software development?

-   You'll be able to isolate where the testing fails happen instead of an overall test. Looking/Testing for the single behavior. We can fix the bugs in that specific part. As you test the team will continue to test everywhere to notice or see other bugs are fails to the application.

3. What are some potential drawbacks of Testing in software development?

-   Testing takes time. It can take days to weeks.
