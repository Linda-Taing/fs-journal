## Questions

1. What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?

-   1.Unit Testing- Allows for testing individuals units   of code in isolation. 2. Component Testing- Allows a reliable test while providing Vue- Specific conveniences. 3. End-To-End (E2E) Testing- This validates all the layers of the application, through the full-stack frontend and backend code.

2. What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?

-   Unit Testing for me is best because I need to code small and test small to make sure things work as they go.

3. What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?

-   E2E if I keep coding and don't test than I won't accomplish the application at all.
