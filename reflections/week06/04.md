Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

-   I'm sure this is going to be a tough day due to the fact that we will be teetering from multiple pages and components nested among each other... I'll say more later... today's also Partner coding and hope that I will be a better partner for helping the setup and run through of functions but really working on turnanaries.
