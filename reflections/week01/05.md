# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week? 

-   This week has been completely new and overwhelming, frustrating, but most of all rewarding. I know this will take time and slowly but surely get to where I need to be! I am understanding a little but with work and practice, practice, practice! I will be not as incompetent.

- What did you learn as a shock or surprise?

-   How much goes into building a webpage to see on different screens. I will not complain about a button not working because now I know the coding somewhat involved.

- What are you struggling with?
 
 -   I struggle with the confidence that I know these things but to execute them is so hard. I will get there and everyone has been reassuring that everyone comes from different back-grounds and can accomplish these things.

- What would you count as a victory?

-   Victory this week was to be able to get closer to cloning a page than I thought I would. I have a long long long way to go but I'll keep climbing!
