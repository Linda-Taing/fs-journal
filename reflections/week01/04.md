## Questions

1. What is the purpose of wire-framing? 

-   The purpose is to help with preplanning of your website or app.

2. What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?

-   Levels of detail can start from pen and paper way to building it out like we did on figma. The complexity and time determine which approach but they both benefit by taking the time first and having a layout and blueprint/structure.

3. Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?

-   They can be for the complex builds and helps guide, but in the long run it can show you the final project before spending the Time Energy and Effort later fixing or not liking what was accomplished.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment
I've learned learning new things and applying them right away is important. There's a lot that goes into being patient with oneself. But working with a partner teaches me to be more assertive in my ideas and confidence because I can do this. I also really enjoyed the workings of figma. Great tool as for wire-framing.
