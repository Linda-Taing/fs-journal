## Questions

1. What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use?

- Psuedo-Class is also a selector that gives them style and action. I feel like we've used :hover multiple times in the case of working with buttons. 

2. What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?

- Specificty is the rule of a value that will be applied code target a property. It's benefits because you can apply to a specific element in the case there are multiple rules to one target.

3. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?

- !important itself overrides all other specifications. I am assuming if they are used multiple times one would really only work. or clash. Not to be used!
