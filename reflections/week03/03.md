## Questions

1. What are the two common operations that we will set in the handler?

-   The two operations are get and set,
get that returns value of the handler and set that takes in 3 arguments- object,property accessed and the value set for property.


2. What do you have to make sure you are doing with every Get to ensure the value does not become `undefined`?

- Get's default is to return a value stored in the key object. when it doesn't have anything to return that's why it is undefined. example from text: get: function(obj, prop)

3. What are some of the benefits of the proxy object that we are using in our structure for applications?

-   Proxy helps so that you can use in place of original objects to be able to access and intercept and define behavior operations.
