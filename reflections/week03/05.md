# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week? 
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?
-   I really thought with the tutor session and the notes I was doing well. But everytime checkpoint comes around I just get way too stressed and overthink and over look everything! I just really want to understand and know how to look up the refernces outside of our lecture assignments. I just get so stuck and frustrated!I will get this one day!!
