# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or surprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

-   This week was a lot of information on connecting the front end and server for the fullstack component of an app. Team building was very important this week because we finished Hack-a-thon. I learned we need to be more diligent on our sprint check-ins. Sometimes we worked through our designated breaks, then get frustrated because we couldn't find the solution. All in all it was a great experience and stress free. I look forward to our capstones and putting forth a  lot more skill!
