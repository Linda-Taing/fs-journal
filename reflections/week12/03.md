# Daily Reflection
Have you started the client? How is you vue application shaping up. Do you have the basics of data rendering to the page.  

## Prompts
- How is today going? I started the client side over the weekend when I couldn't get the back side. I had a great direction on the application with a Jake chat.
- Are you managing your stress? passing all my postman tests and able to route from Vault page and Profile Page.
- What has you most worried? Getting passed the client side with getting vaultKeeps and and creating(adding).
