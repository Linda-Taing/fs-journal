# Daily Reflection
One day left are you going to make it? We believe in you!ðŸ’–! Are you timeboxing appropriately? 

## Prompts
- How is today going? Today has been frustrating. My time box was terrible for 2 checkboxes left. I think that I did finally figure it out but I am going to work in the morning and get last day of 2 gradings to make sure I am in passing order.
- Are you managing your stress? Much better, woke up at 4:30 am to work on the styling to take pressure 
- What has you most worried? that my application will break.
