# Daily Reflection
Two full days in! Did you make the progress you were hoping for yesterday and today? How are you working? Client -> Server, focusing only on the server for now?  

## Prompts
- How is today going? Today was a little more stressful because so many classmates have gone in for grading and passed. I am at 50% and want to be graded so I know what direction to fo. 
- Are you managing your stress? I can but thankfully I am able to talk out my code and ask the correct questions to get the direction.
- What has you most worried? My time frame and boxing were not well. I need to be better on time management.
