# Daily Reflection
This is a stressful week! You are working on a project that closely mimics what you will be expected to accomplish during a standard 40 hour work week. Are you enjoying the struggles? Are you managing your time wisely? 

## Prompts
- How is today going? Today I actually did was a little struggle as I was trying to keep my many to many relationships straight
- Are you managing your stress? I'm okay right now It's still early enough that I am not worried about failing.
- What has you most worried? The many to many relationships in the backend where I am trying to get my vaultKeeps.
