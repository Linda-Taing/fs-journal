## Questions

1. What is Code Documentation? What are some of the ways to document code?

-   Documenting pieces of code to forward on to other developers on what you wrote to give synopsis. Some docs are 'howtos' 'README', code documentation in the code.

2. What are some benefits of Code Documentation?

-   Sending the code with explanation so that you yourself can remember when you come across it later or when handing off a project to another developer down the road.

3. How important is Code documentation and why?

- I think it is important because then you know what arguments and parameters need to be passed through or also when it comes to testing.
