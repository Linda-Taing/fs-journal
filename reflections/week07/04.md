# Sprint Retrospective

![replace_me](https://codeworks.blob.core.windows.net/public/assets/img/illustrations/placeholder.svg)

## Reflect on your partner project and answer the following questions

1. Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?

- All of the above. I didn't realize how confusing tasks can become when we are writing so many similar methods and not remember the path and params and arguments.

2. What went well this week?

-  I had more references and I could talk out my paths, but when it is coming off so many different components and pages and routers I get side tracked and forget the path or just stray. So learning more of the Code Documentation. and trying to get user experience friendly but I am just trying to throw things on the page for funcionality.

3. What would you do differently?

-   Continuously ask questions and timebox.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

- Today was a rough day. I could not hold back tears! This is super overwhelming and I am breaking from it. I know its the last graded checkpoint before the final and I can afford the 2 strikes but I don't want to throw in the towel. I am not a quitter!!
